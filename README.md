## How to run analysis

* For analysing a single program(e.g.: `bzip2-1.0.5` debloated by `chisel` and using the `argv-fuzz` seed file), run:
```
bash -x ./analyse.sh chisel/bzip2-1.0.5-argv-fuzz
```
* For analysing all the programs, run:
```
bash -x ./auto_analyse.sh
```

* After completing the above analysis, files named `deb_lines`, `crash_info`, and `analysis` will be generated for each program. Then we can use the scripts in the `scripts` directory for data analysis. The data is in the `scripts_data` folder.

## Notes
* There are some folders in `crashed_inputs` with similar content but different folder names. This is because a single `error_msg` file could contain multiple distinct soundness issues. We extracted each of these issues individually and stored them in separate folders.
* For some soundness issues where their folder name does not include a stack trace, this is because there is no corresponding stack trace found in the `error_msg` provided by sanitizers. In such cases, we used the `pc` value as a standard for deduplication , which may lead to inaccuracies.
